I received my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science and Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, in June 2018. Following my undergraduate studies, I served as a Research Assistant at SUSTech. Subsequently, I pursued a collaborative Ph.D. program between SUSTech and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) at the UTS Robotics Institute, supervised by Associate Professor Liang Zhao, Professor Shoudong Huang, and Professor Qi Hao (SUSTech). My research focuses on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), with specializations in active SLAM, multi-robot systems, motion planning, and deep reinforcement learning. I recently completed my Ph.D. at UTS.
